  A link has to be made to "AM_CHTML-full.js" for MathJax to work. 
  The "?config=" is telling mathjax to look in the "config" file for "AM_CHTML-full.js" which is stored inside "MathJax-2.6-latest"
  Everything up to the "?config should be the url to the server where the file "MathJax.js" is stored.
